# Pointcloud #

A PostgreSQL extension for storing point cloud (LIDAR) data.

- Mailing list: http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/pgpointcloud/


## Build/Install ##

### Requirements ###

- PostgreSQL and PostgreSQL development packages must be installed (pg_config and server headers). For Red Hat and Ubuntu, the package names are usually "postgresql-dev" or "postgresql-devel"
- LibXML2 development packages must be installed, usually "libxml2-dev" or "libxml2-devel".
- CUnit packages must be installed, or [source built and installed](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cunit/ "CUnit").
- [Optional] GHT library may be installed for GHT compression support, [built from source](http://github.com/pramsey/libght/ "LibGHT")
- [Optional] LAZPERF library may be installed for LAZ compression support, [built from source](http://github.com/hobu/laz-perf "LAZPERF")

Tests can be disabled by passing ``WITH_TESTS=FALSE`` to cmake, e.g. ``cmake .. -DWITH_TESTS=FALSE``.
This removes the CUnit dependency.

### Build ###

#### CMake ####

Make a build directory, and run ``cmake`` from there. Use ``ccmake`` to browse and set the options on your build.

- ``mkdir build``
- ``cd build``
- ``cmake ../``
- ``make``
- ``sudo make install``

Run unit tests:

- ``make check``

#### Autotools ####

After generating the configure script with ``autogen``,  ``./configure --help`` to get a complete listing of configuration options.

- ``./autogen.sh``
- ``./configure``
- ``make``
- ``sudo make install``

Run unit tests:

- ``make check``

Note that if you configured PointCloud using a non-standard LibGHT location, you may need to add its location to the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variable. For example:

- ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/local/lib make check``

### SQL Tests ###

pointcloud includes SQL tests to run against an existing installation.

Run the SQL tests:

- `sudo make install`
- `PGUSER=a_user PGPASSWORD=a_password PGHOST=localhost make installcheck`

This command will create a database named `contrib_regression` and will execute the SQL scripts located in `pgsql/sql` in this database.

### Activate ###

- Create a new database: ``CREATE DATABASE mynewdb``
- Connect to that database.
- Activate the pointcloud extension: ``CREATE EXTENSION pointcloud``

## Schemas ##

LIDAR sensors quickly produce millions of points with large numbers of variables measured on each point. The challenge for a point cloud database extension is efficiently storing this data while allowing high fidelity access to the many variables stored. 

Much of the complexity in handling LIDAR comes from the need to deal with multiple variables per point. The variables captured by LIDAR sensors varies by sensor and capture process. Some data sets might contain only X/Y/Z values. Others will contain dozens of variables: X, Y, Z; intensity and return number; red, green, and blue values; return times; and many more. There is no consistency in how variables are stored: intensity might be stored in a 4-byte integer, or in a single byte; X/Y/Z might be doubles, or they might be scaled 4-byte integers. 

PostgreSQL Pointcloud deals with all this variability by using a "schema document" to describe the contents of any particular LIDAR point. Each point contains a number of dimensions, and each dimension can be of any data type, with scaling and/or offsets applied to move between the actual value and the value stored in the database. The schema document format used by PostgreSQL Pointcloud is the same one used by the [PDAL](http://pointcloud.org) library.

Here is a simple 4-dimensional schema document you can insert into `pointcloud_formats` to work with the examples below:

    INSERT INTO pointcloud_formats (pcid, srid, schema) VALUES (1, 4326, 
    '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <pc:PointCloudSchema xmlns:pc="http://pointcloud.org/schemas/PC/1.1"

      </pc:metadata>
    </pc:PointCloudSchema>');

Schema documents are stored in the ``pointcloud_formats`` table, along with a ``pcid`` or "pointcloud identifier". Rather than store the whole schema information with each database object, each object just has a `pcid`, which serves as a key to find the schema in ``pointcloud_formats``.  This is similar to the way the ``srid`` is resolved for spatial reference system support in [PostGIS](http://postgis.net).

The central role of the schema document in interpreting the contents of a point cloud object means that care must be taken to ensure that the right `pcid` reference is being used in objects, and that it references a valid schema document in the `pointcloud_formats` table.


## Point Cloud Objects ##

### PcPoint ###

The basic point cloud type is a `PcPoint`. Every point has a (large?) number of dimensions, but at a minimum an X and Y coordinate that place it in space. 

Points can be rendered in a human-readable JSON form using the `PC_AsText(pcpoint)` function. The "pcid" is the foreign key reference to the `pointcloud_formats` table, where the meaning of each dimension in the "pt" array of doubles is explained. The underlying storage of the data might not be double, but by the time it has been extracted, scaled and offset, it is representable as doubles.

    {
        "pcid" : 1,
          "pt" : [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 4]
    }


### PcPatch ###

The structure of database storage is such that storing billions of points as individual records in a table is not an efficient use of resources. Instead, we collect a group of `PcPoint` into a `PcPatch`. Each patch should hopefully contain points that are near together. 

Instead of a table of billions of single `PcPoint` records, a collection of LIDAR data can be represented in the database as a much smaller collection (10s of millions) of `PcPatch` records. 

Patches can be rendered into a human-readable JSON form using the `PC_AsText(pcpatch)` function.  The "pcid" is the foreign key reference to the `pointcloud_formats` table.

    {
        "pcid" : 1,
         "pts" : [
                  [0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 6],
                  [0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 8]
                 ]
    }

## Tables ##

Usually you will only be creating tables for storing `PcPatch` objects, and using `PcPoint` objects as transitional objects for filtering, but it is possible to create tables of both types. `PcPatch` and `PcPoint` columns both require an argument that indicate the `pcid` that will be used to interpret the column. 

    -- This example requires the schema entry from the previous 
    -- section to be loaded so that pcid==1 exists.

    -- A table of points
    CREATE TABLE points (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        pt PCPOINT(1)
    );

    -- A table of patches
    CREATE TABLE patches (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        pa PCPATCH(1)
    );

In addition to any tables you create, you will find two other system-provided point cloud tables,

- the `pointcloud_formats` table that holds all the pcid entries and schema documents
- the `pointcloud_columns` view, that displays all the columns in your database that contain point cloud objects

Now that you have created two tables, you'll see entries for them in the `pointcloud_columns` view:

    SELECT * FROM pointcloud_columns;

     schema |    table    | column | pcid | srid |  type   
    --------+-------------+--------+------+------+---------
     public | points      | pt     |    1 | 4326 | pcpoint
     public | patches     | pa     |    1 | 4326 | pcpatch

>
> If `reinterpret` is `true` then the values of the points may change for dimensions where the offset and/or scale are different between the "old" and the "new" schema. And `defaultvalue`, which defaults to `0.0`, will be used for dimensions that are in the new schema but not in the old schema. The values of dimensions that are in the old schema but not in the new schema will be discarded.

## PostGIS Integration ##

The `pointcloud_postgis` extension adds functions that allow you to use PostgreSQL Pointcloud with PostGIS, converting PcPoint and PcPatch to Geometry and doing spatial filtering on point cloud data. The `pointcloud_postgis` extension depends on both the `postgis` and `pointcloud` extensions, so they must be installed first:

    CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
    CREATE EXTENSION pointcloud;
    CREATE EXTENSION pointcloud_postgis;

## Compressions ##

One of the issues with LIDAR data is that there is a lot of it. To deal with data volumes, PostgreSQL Pointcloud allows schemas to declare their preferred compression method in the `<pc:metadata>` block of the schema document. In the example schema, we declared our compression as follows:

    <pc:metadata>
      <Metadata name="compression">dimensional</Metadata>
    </pc:metadata>

There are currently four supported compressions:

- **None**, which stores points and patches as byte arrays using the type and formats described in the schema document.
- **Dimensional**, which stores points the same as 'none' but stores patches as collections of dimensional data arrays, with an "appropriate" compression applied. Dimensional compression makes the most sense for smaller patch sizes, since small patches will tend to have more homogeneous dimensions.
- **GHT** or "GeoHash Tree", which stores the points in a tree where each node stores the common values shared by all nodes below. For larger patch sizes, GHT should provide effective compression and performance for patch-wise operations. You must build Pointcloud with libght support to make use of the GHT compression.
- **LAZ** or "LASZip". You must build Pointcloud with LAZPERF support to make use of the LAZ compression.

If no compression is declared in `<pc:metadata>`, then a compression of "none" is assumed.

### Dimensional Compression ###

Dimensional compression first flips the patch representation from a list of N points containing M dimension values to a list of M dimensions each containing N values.

    {"pcid":1,"pts":[
          [-126.99,45.01,1,0],[-126.98,45.02,2,0],[-126.97,45.03,3,0],
          [-126.96,45.04,4,0],[-126.95,45.05,5,0],[-126.94,45.06,6,0]
         ]}

Becomes, notionally:

    {"pcid":1,"dims":[
          [-126.99,-126.98,-126.97,-126.96,-126.95,-126.94],
          [45.01,45.02,45.03,45.04,45.05,45.06],
          [1,2,3,4,5,6],
          [0,0,0,0,0,0]
         ]}

The potential benefit for compression is that each dimension has quite different distribution characteristics, and is amenable to different approaches.  In this example, the fourth dimension (intensity) can be very highly compressed with run-length encoding (one run of six zeros). The first and second dimensions have relatively low variability relative to their magnitude and can be compressed by removing the repeated bits.

Dimensional compression currently uses only three compression schemes:

- run-length encoding, for dimensions with low variability
- common bits removal, for dimensions with variability in a narrow bit range
- raw deflate compression using zlib, for dimensions that aren't amenable to the other schemes

For LIDAR data organized into patches of points that sample similar areas, the dimensional scheme compresses at between 3:1 and 5:1 efficiency.


## Binary Formats ##

In order to preserve some compactness in dump files and network transmissions, the binary formats need to retain their native compression.  All binary formats are hex-encoded before output. 

The point and patch binary formats start with a common header, which provides:

- endianness flag, to allow portability between architectures
- pcid number, to look up the schema information in the `pointcloud_formats` table

The patch binary formats have additional standard header information:

- the compression number, which indicates how to interpret the data
- the number of points in the patch


### Point Binary ###

    byte:     endianness (1 = NDR, 0 = XDR)
    uint32:   pcid (key to POINTCLOUD_SCHEMAS)
    uchar[]:  pointdata (interpret relative to pcid)

### Patch Binary ###

### Patch Binary (Uncompressed) ####

    byte:         endianness (1 = NDR, 0 = XDR)
    uint32:       pcid (key to POINTCLOUD_SCHEMAS)
    uint32:       0 = no compression
    uint32:       npoints
    pointdata[]:  interpret relative to pcid

### Patch Binary (Dimensional) ###

    byte:          endianness (1 = NDR, 0 = XDR)
    uint32:        pcid (key to POINTCLOUD_SCHEMAS)
    uint32:        2 = dimensional compression
    uint32:        npoints
    dimensions[]:  dimensionally compressed data for each dimension

Each compressed dimension starts with a byte, that gives the compression type, and then a uint32 that gives the size of the segment in bytes.

    byte:           dimensional compression type (0-3)
    uint32:         size of the compressed dimension in bytes
    data[]:         the compressed dimensional values

There are four possible compression types used in dimensional compression:

- no compression = 0,
- run-length compression = 1,
- significant bits removal = 2,
- deflate = 3

    
#### No dimension compress ####

For dimensional compression 0 (no compression) the values just appear in order. The length of words in this dimension must be determined from the schema document.

    word[]:

#### Run-length compress dimension ####

For run-length compression, the data stream consists of a set of pairs: a byte value indicating the length of the run, and a data value indicating the value that is repeated.

     byte:          number of times the word repeats
     word:          value of the word being repeated
     ....           repeated for the number of runs

The length of words in this dimension must be determined from the schema document.

#### Significant bits removal on dimension ####

Significant bits removal starts with two words. The first word just gives the number of bits that are "significant", that is the number of bits left after the common bits are removed from any given word. The second word is a bitmask of the common bits, with the final, variable bits zeroed out.

     word1:          number of variable bits in this dimension
     word2:          the bits that are shared by every word in this dimension
     data[]:         variable bits packed into a data buffer

#### Deflate dimension ####

Where simple compression schemes fail, general purpose compression is applied to the dimension using zlib. The data area is a raw zlib buffer suitable for passing directly to the inflate() function. The size of the input buffer is given in the common dimension header. The size of the output buffer can be derived from the patch metadata by multiplying the dimension word size by the number of points in the patch.

### Patch Binary (GHT) ####

    byte:          endianness (1 = NDR, 0 = XDR)
    uint32:        pcid (key to POINTCLOUD_SCHEMAS)
    uint32:        1 = GHT compression
    uint32:        npoints
    uint32:        GHT data size
    uint8:         GHT data

GHT patches are much like dimensional patches, except their internal structure is more opaque. Use LibGHT to read the GHT data buffer out into a GHT tree in memory.

### Patch Binary (LAZ) ####

    byte:          endianness (1 = NDR, 0 = XDR)
    uint32:        pcid (key to POINTCLOUD_SCHEMAS)
    uint32:        3 = LAZ compression
    uint32:        npoints
    uint32:        LAZ data size
    data[]:        LAZ data

LAZ patches are much like GHT patches. Use LAZPERF library to read the LAZ data buffer out into a LAZ buffer.

## Loading Data ##

The examples above show how to form patches from array of doubles, and well-known binary. You can write your own loader, using the uncompressed WKB format, or more simply you can load existing LIDAR files using the [PDAL](https://www.pdal.io) processing and format conversion library.

### From WKB ###

If you are writing your own loading system and want to write into Pointcloud types, create well-known binary inputs, in uncompressed format. If you schema indicates that your patch storage is compressed, Pointcloud will automatically compress your patch before storing it, so you can create patches in uncompressed WKB without worrying about the nuances of particular internal compression schemes.

The only issues to watch when creating WKB patches are: ensuring the data you write is sized according to the schema (use the specified dimension type); ensuring that the endianness of the data matches the declared endianness of the patch.

### From PDAL ###

#### Build and Install PDAL ####

To build and install PDAL check out the [PDAL development
documentation](https://www.pdal.io/development).

With PDAL installed you're ready to run a PDAL import into PostgreSQL PointCloud!

#### Running `pdal pipeline` ####

PDAL includes a [command line program](http://www.pointcloud.org/apps.html) that allows both simple format translations and more complex "pipelines" of transformation.  The `pdal translate` does simple format transformations. In order to load data into Pointcloud we use a "PDAL pipeline", by calling `pdal pipeline`. A pipeline combines a format reader, and format writer, with filters that can alter or group the points together.

PDAL pipelines are JSON files, which declare readers, filters, and writers forming a processing chain that will be applied to the LIDAR data.

To execute a pipeline file, run it through the `pdal pipeline` command:

    pdal pipeline --input pipelinefile.json

Here is a simple example pipeline that reads a LAS file and writes into a PostgreSQL Pointcloud database.

```json
{
  "pipeline":[
    {
      "type":"readers.las",
      "filename":"/home/lidar/st-helens-small.las",
      "spatialreference":"EPSG:26910"
    },
    {
      "type":"filters.chipper",
      "capacity":400
    }
    {
      "type":"writers.pgpointcloud",
      "connection":"host='localhost' dbname='pc' user='lidar'",
      "table":"sthsm",
      "compression":"dimensional",
      "srid":"26910"
    }
  ]
}
```

PostgreSQL Pointcloud storage of LIDAR works best when each "patch" of points consists of points that are close together, and when most patches do not overlap. In order to convert unordered data from a LIDAR file into patch-organized data in the database, we need to pass it through a filter to "chip" the data into compact patches. The "chipper" is one of the filters we need to apply to the data while loading.

Similarly, reading data from a PostgreSQL Pointcloud uses a Pointcloud reader and a file writer of some sort. This example reads from the database and writes to a CSV text file:

```json
{
  "pipeline":[
    {
      "type":"readers.pgpointcloud",
      "connection":"host=localhost dbname='pc' user='lidar'",
      "table":"sthsm",
      "column":"pa",
      "spatialreference":"EPSG:26910"
    },
    {
      "type":"writers.text",
      "filename":"/home/lidar/st-helens-small-out.txt"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that we do not need to chip the data stream when reading from the database, as the writer does not care if the points are blocked into patches or not.

You can use the "where" option to restrict a read to just an envelope, allowing partial extracts from a table:

```json
{
  "pipeline":[
    {
      "type":"readers.pgpointcloud",
      "connection":"host=localhost dbname='pc' user='lidar'",
      "table":"sthsm",
      "column":"pa",
      "spatialreference":"EPSG:26910",
      "where":"PC_Intersects(pa, ST_MakeEnvelope(560037.36, 5114846.45, 562667.31, 5118943.24, 26910))",
    },
    {
      "type":"writers.text",
      "filename":"/home/lidar/st-helens-small-out.txt"
    }
  ]
}
```
